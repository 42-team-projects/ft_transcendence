Yes, it's perfectly fine to use a player ID in a REST API, as long as you follow certain best practices to ensure security and efficiency. Here are some key considerations:

Best Practices for Using IDs in REST APIs:
Use UUIDs Instead of Sequential IDs:

Sequential IDs like 1, 2, 3, etc. can make your API vulnerable to enumeration attacks, where an attacker could guess valid IDs and retrieve unauthorized data. Using UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) makes this much harder since they are long and random, reducing the risk of ID guessing.
Authorization and Access Control:

Ensure that users are authorized to access the data they request. For example, just because a player ID is included in a request doesnâ€™t mean the requesting user should have access to that player's information. Implement authentication (JWT, OAuth) and check permissions for every request.
Secure Data Transmission:

Always use HTTPS to ensure that player IDs (and any other data) are transmitted securely. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks where IDs could be intercepted.
Data Privacy:

Ensure that exposing a player ID does not inadvertently reveal sensitive information. The player ID itself should be treated as an opaque identifier with no inherent meaning outside your system.
Rate Limiting and API Throttling:

To prevent abuse (e.g., brute force attacks on player IDs), implement rate limiting on your API, especially for sensitive operations like GET /players/{id} or DELETE /players/{id}.
Example Use Case:
If you are building an endpoint like /players/{id}, it's natural and common to use the player ID to identify the specific resource. For instance:

GET /players/{player_id} to retrieve a specific player's details.
PUT /players/{player_id} to update a player's information.
DELETE /players/{player_id} to delete a player.
In this structure, as long as you follow the best practices outlined above, using the player ID in the API is a good approach.
